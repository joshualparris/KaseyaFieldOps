  problemSolved: 'Provides comprehensive image-based backup, business continuity, and disaster recovery (BCDR) for servers and workstations.',
  mentalModel: 'Think of it as a time machine for your servers. It takes frequent image-based snapshots of entire systems, allowing you to instantly spin up a virtual copy of a failed server either locally on the Datto appliance (SIRIS) or in the Datto Cloud.',
  actualUseCases: [
    'Restoring an entire server after a catastrophic hardware failure.',
    'Recovering a system from a ransomware attack by rolling back to a known good snapshot.',
    'Spinning up a failed server locally on the Datto appliance to keep a business running (Local Virtualization).',
    'Spinning up a server in the Datto Cloud if the physical site is destroyed (Cloud Virtualization).',
  ],
  commonWorkflows: [
    'Deploying the Datto Windows or Linux Agent to a protected system.',
    'Configuring local backup schedules and cloud replication settings.',
    'Performing a file-level restore for deleted documents.',
    'Executing a bare metal restore (BMR) to new hardware.',
  ],
  whenNotToUse: [
    'Do not use this for backing up Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace cloud data (use Datto SaaS Protection).',
    'Do not use this for simple roaming laptop file backup (use Datto File Protection).',

  keyTerminology: [
    { term: 'SIRIS', definition: 'The enterprise-grade Datto BCDR appliance line capable of local virtualization.' },
    { term: 'ALTO', definition: 'The small-business Datto BCDR appliance line (relies on cloud for virtualization).' },
    { term: 'Inverse Chain Technology', definition: 'Datto\'s proprietary backup format where every snapshot is a fully bootable recovery point, eliminating the need for dependent backup chains.' },
    { term: 'Screenshot Verification', definition: 'An automated process where the Datto appliance spins up the backup as a VM, takes a screenshot of the login screen, and validates recoverability.' },

    'Confused with Datto File Protection: BCDR is image-based (the whole OS and apps), File Protection is file/folder only.',

  problemSolved: 'Provides continuous file and folder backup for workstations and laptops, especially for roaming users who rarely connect to the corporate network.',
  mentalModel: 'Think of it as a highly secure, centrally managed alternative to local hard drives or simple cloud sync. It silently backs up user files (Documents, Desktop, Downloads) continuously over any internet connection directly to the Datto Cloud.',
  actualUseCases: [
    'Backing up executive laptops that travel frequently.',
    'Protecting remote workers who don\'t connect to a central file server.',
    'Allowing end-users to self-restore a deleted file without opening a helpdesk ticket.',
  ],
  commonWorkflows: [
    'Deploying the Datto File Protection Desktop agent silently via Datto RMM.',
    'Creating backup profiles to specify which folders to include or exclude.',
    'Restoring a file from a previous version (up to 180 days retention).',
  ],
  whenNotToUse: [
    'Do not use this for backing up applications, databases, or operating systems (use Datto SIRIS/ALTO).',
    'Do not use this for backing up Microsoft 365 cloud data (use Datto SaaS Protection).',
  ],
  keyTerminology: [
    { term: 'DFP Desktop', definition: 'The software agent installed on workstations to facilitate backups.' },
    { term: 'DFP Server', definition: 'A specific version of the agent for backing up server file shares.' },
    { term: 'Backup Profile', definition: 'A centralized configuration dictating what paths are backed up and what file extensions are excluded.' },

  commonConfusions: [
    'Confused with Datto Backup (BCDR): DFP cannot restore an operating system or perform virtualization. It only restores files.',
    'Confused with OneDrive: While OneDrive syncs files, DFP is a true backup solution with immutable version history (up to 180 days) managed entirely by the MSP.',
